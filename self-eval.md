# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
<br> It actually felt very satisfying to use my knowlege to take this challenge on with a couple of my classmates.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
<br> I am doing very well at keeping focus and taking breaks when needed. I believe I have a very effective workflow going at the moment.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
<br> I will continue to grow my knowledge of these key lessons we have learned so far. I will also be maintaining and fine tuning basic lifestyle habits to promote a good learning/working environment.
